# DS5500-Capstone-Project-Phase-2---IMDb-user-rating-prediction

Summary:
IMDb (Internet Movie Database) is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos, video games, and streaming content online – including cast, production crew, and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan, and critical reviews. Users are invited to rate any film or TV series on a scale of 1 to 10, and the totals are converted into a weighted mean-rating that is displayed beside each title, with online filters employed to deter ballot-stuffing. [1]

Many users choose to check the IMDb rating of a movie before they watch the movie, to assess the quality of the movie and also to see if they will enjoy it. Usually higher the IMDb rating, the better the chances of users picking that movie to watch and thereby increasing the gross income for the movie. This way IMDb rating doesn’t only help the users decide what movie to watch, but also plays a role in how much money and viewership a movie or TV show will have. 

In this project, we will be using supervised machine learning to predict IMDb movie user ratings of a movie before it is released. We will be using text features from the summary provided, along with other features like gross income, meta score, genre, etc. We will create feature vectors from the text present in the one-line summary of the movie using features like number of positive words, number of negative words, number of words in the summary, number of adjectives, number of verbs, etc.
